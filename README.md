Submitting homework with GitHub: a 3-minute guide
-------------------------------------------------

This guide will walk you through creating a GitHub 
account, forking a homework repository to contain your 
homework for one week, and creating new a file for
assignments in that homework.

### To create a GitHub account ###

If you already have a personal GitHub account, feel free to use that -- no need to create a new one for this course. If you don't have an account, create one:

1. Head over to [GitHub.com](http://github.com).
2. Enter your choice of username, your school email address, and your choice of password.
3. Click the big green "Sign up for GitHub" button.
4. If prompted, choose the "free" plan.

### To fork an assignment repository ###

1.  Visit any page in the repository and click the "Fork" button:
    
    ![Fork repository](img/how-to-fork.png?raw=true)

### To create a new file for an assignment ###

1.  Click the "Create new file" button on your repository page:
    
    ![New File](img/new-file.png?raw=true)
    
    Note that you can also click the "Upload files" button instead to add images, movies, or other file times to your repository.

2.  Give your new file a sensible name, like "exercise-1.js". The file extension you choose  (".js" here) should match
    the programming language used in the file; for Javascript use ".js". 
    For Processing, use ".pde"; for Arduino, use ".ino".
    
    Then, paste your code into the "Edit new file" tab.
    
    Finally, click the "Commit new file" button.

3.  To edit the main repository `README.md` file, or if you later wish to 
    make changes to your code, you can do so through github as well. First,
    find the file you'd like to change, and click on the file name:
    
    ![File list](img/file-list.png?raw=true)
    
    Then, click the "Edit this file" icon:
    
    ![Edit file](img/edit-file.png?raw=true)
    
    Make your changes as in step 2 above.
